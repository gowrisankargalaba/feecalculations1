        <p>To calculate the total cost, starting salary, and break-even point based on rank and marks, we need to derive appropriate formulas. We can make assumptions for these calculations, but ideally, these should be based on historical data and statistical analysis. Here’s how you can approach each calculation:</p>
        <p><b>1. Total Cost: </b> This is the total amount of money you will need to spend on your education, including tuition fees and other expenses. For example, ₹800,000.</p>
        <p>The total cost usually includes tuition fees, living expenses, and other miscellaneous costs. Here’s a basic formula to estimate it:</p>
        <p>Total Cost=Tuition Fee+Living Expenses+Other Costs</p>
        <p><b>Estimating Tuition Fee:</b></p>
        <p>Tuition Fee=a+b*Rank-c*Marks</p>
        <p>Where:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a is the base tuition fee.</li>
            <li>b is the coefficient for rank.</li>
            <li>c is the coefficient for marks.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Living Expenses and Other Costs:</b></p>
        <p>These can be considered constant or can be adjusted based on specific data.</p>
        <p><b>2. Starting Salary: </b> This is the amount of money you can expect to earn per year when you get your first job after graduation. For example, ₹600,000/year.</p>
        <p>Starting salary can be influenced by rank and marks, reflecting the student's performance and the college's reputation. Here’s a basic formula:</p>
        <p>Starting Salary=d-e*Rank+f*Marks</p>
        <p>Where:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>d is the base starting salary.</li>
            <li>e is the coefficient for rank.</li>
            <li>f is the coefficient for marks.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>3. Break-even Point: </b> This is the amount of time it will take for you to earn back the money you spent on your education. For example, 1.33 years.</p>
        <p>The break-even point is the time it takes to recover the total cost of education through earnings from the starting salary.</p>
        <p>Break-even Point= Starting Salary/TotalCost</p>
        <p><h6>Assumed Values:</h6></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Base Tuition Fee (a) = ₹200,000</li>
            <li>Rank Coefficient (b) = ₹100</li>
            <li>Marks Coefficient (c) = ₹500</li>
            <li>Living Expenses = ₹100,000</li>
            <li>Other Costs = ₹50,000</li>
            <li>Base Starting Salary (d) = ₹600,000</li>
            <li>Rank Coefficient (e) = ₹50</li>
            <li>Marks Coefficient (f) = ₹200</li>
        </ul>
